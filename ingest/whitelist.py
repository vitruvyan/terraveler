Two classes of domain
---------------------
Most entries here are *domain-guaranteed*: everything gutenberg.org serves is
public domain, so knowing the host is enough. archive.org is not like that. It
hosts public-domain scans and in-copyright lending books side by side, under
the same URL shape, and the catalogue title gives no hint which is which.

That distinction is not theoretical. Three of the first source proposals for
the voyage queue were famous books in unusable editions, and all three were on
archive.org:

  - Columbus's Diario — Dunn & Kelley, University of Oklahoma Press, 1989,
    access-restricted-item: true.
  - Ibn Battuta — a Cambridge UP reprint of 2012, lending only, carrying an
    1829 title.
  - Cartier — the open Biggar 1924 sits beside restricted modern editions.

An author dead six centuries says nothing about the copyright of the volume in
front of you: the translator, the editor and the scanning library each start
their own clock. So archive.org is admitted *per item*, verified against the
item's own metadata at fetch time, and never on trust.
