"""The Curator's mechanical checks, and the prose they are read as.

This is the half of `desk_review.py` that decides nothing about the world: it
looks at a draft, says what it noticed, and hands back a list. It was split out
of that script when the verdict pass became a Motus graph, because a node has
to be a function of its inputs and the checks already were.

WHY A FINDING IS NOT A SENTENCE ANY MORE
----------------------------------------
A finding used to be `["FAIL", 0, "wp3.claim1: NOT FOUND in the live source —
fabricated or altered (Carta 3.4). Offered: 'the voyage began'"]`, and that
string went into `audit_log.findings` and onto the contributor's screen.

It now leaves here as a shape:

    {"level": "FAIL", "where": "wp3.claim1", "code": "QUOTE_ABSENT",
     "args": {"seq": 3, "ci": 1}}

and the sentence is composed at recording time by `compose()`, out of the
draft's payload and the spans located in the sources — both of which are in
the database, where they already were.

The reason is the trace. The verdict pass runs on Motus now, its every fact
lands in an immutable trace, and that trace's root is published on a public
chain so a verdict cannot be edited afterwards without the edit showing. A
finding carrying the draft's own words would put the draft's own words in the
thing being published, and would put a second copy of a quotation that already
exists in `submissions.payload` and in `verified_spans` into a third place that
must then be kept in step with both. Counts, offsets, source URLs and enum
values are what a trace is for; the words are what the database is for.

Nothing here reads the network or the database. The one exception is stated
where it happens: `verify_quotation` is handed the source text, it does not go
and get it.
