"""The Curator's verdict pass, as a Motus graph.

Carta §2 gives the Curator the power to issue `approved | rejected |
changes-requested`, and §5 makes every verdict motivated, cited and appealable.
That is a graph with decisions and routing, and until now it was a script with
`if`s: the branch a verdict took existed only in the moment the interpreter
took it, and the record left behind was a row someone with the database
password could edit afterwards, silently.

This is the pass rebuilt so that cannot be true. Every verdict is a recorded
`Decision`, the routing is *on that decision* so the branch is a fact rather
than a control-flow event nobody can see, and the whole run leaves an immutable
trace whose records are hash-chained and whose root is published on a public
chain (`scripts/anchor.py`). A verdict that was edited afterwards no longer
matches the root that was published before the edit, and anyone can check it
with `motus-validate`, trusting neither this code nor its author.

WHAT THE TRACE CARRIES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO
----------------------------------------------
Shapes. Counts, lengths, offsets, source URLs, enum values, digests. Not the
draft's words and not the source's.

That is not squeamishness, it is what makes the anchor publishable: the root
covers everything in the trace, and a trace holding a contributor's unpublished
draft is a draft you cannot anchor without publishing it. It is also the only
way to keep one fact in one place — the quotation is already in
`submissions.payload`, the located span is already in `verified_spans`, and a
third copy inside a trace is a third thing to keep in step with the other two.

The binding between the shapes and the words is a digest, and it is the point:
`findings_digest` covers the exact sentences written to `audit_log`, and
`spans_digest` covers the exact spans written to `verified_spans`. Edit either
row afterwards and it no longer hashes to what the anchored trace committed to.

WHY SO FEW NODES ARE `pure`
---------------------------
Only `decide` is. Every check reads the draft out of the database rather than
out of the state, because the state is the trace and the draft is exactly what
the trace must not carry — so a check that could have been a pure function of
its inputs is honestly a node that reads the outside world. Each read records
the payload's SHA-256 in its effect description, so a trace shows whether all
four checks saw the same bytes, which a single cached read could only assert.
