"""The Curator's verdict graph, and the trace it is only worth as much as.

    python3 -m unittest test_desk_graph -v          (from scripts/)

No database and no network. Every outside read is stubbed with something
deterministic and derived from its input, which is what makes the assertions
mean anything: the run below is the run production performs, minus the two
places it reaches out.

The test that matters is `TamperedTrace`. Everything else here checks that the
pass rules the way it always ruled; that one checks that the evidence it leaves
is evidence — that altering a recorded value makes the trace fail its own
validator, by name. A trace nobody can refute is a log.
